Key Coding Projects in Python

Demonstrated R skills:

•	Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Data collection, processing, transformation, management, and analysis
•	Leveraged applied statistics, information visualization (including Geolocation), text mining and machine learning

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS

• State Population = Analyze census data from census.gov with user created functions in R.
• New York Air Quality = Generate visual graphs to represent New York air quality. (histographs, bar graphs, heatmaps, and 
  scatterplots)
• US Income by Zip Code = Generate geospatial visualizations that highlight differences in state by state and region by region wealth.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS

• New York Air Quality2 = Predict exact ozone concentrations and classes (e.g. good, bad) using Support Vector Machines and Naive-Bayes
  models. Discuss which yields better results and why.
