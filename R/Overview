Key Coding Projects in R

Demonstrated R skills:

•	Structured, Semi-Structured, and Unstructured Data collection, processing, transformation, management, and analysis
•	Leveraged applied statistics, information visualization (including Geolocation), text mining and machine learning

DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS

• State Population = Analyze census data from census.gov with user created functions in R.
• New York Air Quality = Generate visual graphs to represent New York air quality. (histographs, bar graphs, heatmaps, and 
  scatterplots)
• US Income by Zip Code = Generate geospatial visualizations that highlight differences in state by state and region by region wealth.

PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS

• New York Air Quality2 = Predict exact ozone concentrations and classes (e.g. good, bad) using Support Vector Machines and Naive-Bayes
  models. Discuss which yields better results and why.
• Customer_Acquistion_with_AR = Analyze demographic data and banking information to determine if a person will be interested in a new PEP 
  (Personal Equity Plan) using association rule mining. (**Raw Code Included**)
• History Mystery = Use hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) and K-means clustering to predict authorship of Founding Fathers' 
  disputed essays. (**Raw Code Included**)
• Handwriting Recognition = Use Decision Tress, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and Random Forest to predict 
  handwritten digits from the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) database. (**Raw Code Included**)
• Lie Detection = Use Naive-Bayes and Support Vector Machines to detect false restaurant reviews. (**Raw Code Included**)
